There are two types of goals:
- solution-defining: These are goals that lose sight of the actual purpose of
  the goal with the form/appearance of the solution. Sometimes itâ€™ll be bundled
  with the purpose. For example:...

- purpose-defining: These goals only define what the purpose of the goal is. It
  will accept any solution so long as it fullfils the purpose of the goal. It
  focusses on the effect of the solution and not the form of the solution.
  Among the two purpose-defing goals are compatible with the iterative process
  of unfolding.
