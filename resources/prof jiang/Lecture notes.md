- Memories are stored in the spirit world
- we recieve ideas/revelations from the spirit world contrary to what the scientific method claims

There's a major problem that modern neuroscience, psychology, etc have failed to solve, that is the problem of where our memories are stored. Modern neuroscience has laid out a lot of the mechanisms of the human brain but it fails to pinpoint where exactly human memories are stored. So just where is it stored?

Immanuel Kant, one of the most influential philosophers of all time, proposed that we interfaced with reality (noumena) through concepts such as space and time to produce our own immediate interactable reality called the phenomenon. So basically all humans are born with apriori knowledge of time & space to preceive reality but then a question arrises Are we even perceiving the same reality? Whose to say our conceptions of time & space aren't different? Well to solve this problem Hegel comes along and introduces the concept of the **Geist** (or the spirit world). Hegel claims that we all share a collective "consiousness" so to speak, that we are connected with one another where we exchange information this is the Geist. Its sort of similar to the internet. So Hegel says that our concepts of time & space come from this Geist and therefore he claims that we experience the same reality (phenomenon). But then who decides what concept to favour? Is it simply majority wins or is there some other law/principle that decides what the concept should be?

Coming back to the question of where our memories are stored, its in the Geist. Our memories are stored in the Geist, Does that mean we can access the memories of others?
Yeah I guess but to what extent?

(dude then what was the point of that quantum mechanics mumbo jumbo he did?)


- Ok but why are we even limiting our selves with concepts of space and time? Just what is it that stops us from directly interfacing with the Noumena?
