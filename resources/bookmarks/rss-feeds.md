    - a former lessWrong writer that writes about a lot of things, though the
      most eye catching part about it for me is the design of his site - its
      made so well with features like backlinks, reference-archiving(when he
      references websites he archives them so they don't get lost to time),
      window-manager-like navigation, and his ontologies for describing his
      essays

    - a blog post explaining how the author used a receipt printer to manage
      their swe todo list, sort of reminds me of how restraunts have a ticket
      system and I began thinking what if we could have that which was inspired
      by an analogy of a swe with a baker (https://www.hermit-tech.com/blog/data-engineers-and-bakers)
