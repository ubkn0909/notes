# markup language for socratic dialogoue
As a tool for thought what if we made a lightweight markup language like
makrdown, org, neorg, etc but to support socratic dialogoue.

The first feature would be that by the end of every sentence or any other
strucutre(paragraph or dialogoue) it tabs the newline so that you may write a
response back to the dialogoue, like in chatting only you're talking to
yourself.

But cmon you can do that without needing an entirely new markup language. All it
does is add aesthetics to the text so it looks like a chat.
