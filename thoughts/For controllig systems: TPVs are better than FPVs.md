well the main problem lies with feedback any animal is literally connected to its body parts and can instantly sense anything happening to it but with first person view controlled systems, say drones, you just don't have that awareness/sensation of the body part you're spatial awareness is a mess and when you do collide you can't "feel" the collision. TPVs solve some of those problems I think
