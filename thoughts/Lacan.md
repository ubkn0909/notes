**We do not dream to escape reality on the contrary we escape the dream through reality**
Lacan poses that:
- Reality is the [collective] dream of the bodies
- a body needs deep sleep in order to keep on "dreaming" reality

I want to draw parallels to this with viewing sleep from the evolutionary perspective:
Evolutionarily speaking sleep just doesn't make any sense. Why would the body leave itself ungaurded for hours just to *sleep*? Perhaps because the body needs to face the Real or something like that in order to sustain itself?
I am just throwing a buncha stuff around, I mean I still don't really understand the implications of "reality being a dream of bodies".

According to Lacan we are all "subjects" but what are subjects?

The symbolic, the Real, and the Imaginary. These three are the central landscapes of the subject.
- Symbolic
	- consists of the signifier and the signified
	- order or structure of meaning for a subject

- Imaginary
	- the imaginary is the ideal "images" of things in the subjects head
- Real
	- the truamatic point of incoherence, or the impossible
	- not to be confused with reality

Fantasy is symbolic + imaginary
The real is not to be confused with reality. The reality is our projection of fantisies. It is not that we escape reality through dreams but contrarily we escape our dream through the fantasy of reality.
What are dreams? dreams are what prolong sleep (to prevent one from waking up to reality)
The dream of the burning boy. One of Freuds patient had a dream when he fell a sleep next to his dead sons coffin. In the dream his son appears on flame and whispers to him "father I am burning". When he wakes up he finds a small fire lit on the coffin of his son... but why did he wake up? the immediate logical answer is that the fire burning caused discomfort thus waking him from his sleep. However Lacan reads this dream a bit differently. Fuuuuckk I don't have a clue as to what all this meannnnnnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsn
