## What the fuck is "action" overload?
Action overload is when you are overwhelmed with the chaos of things you need to do. Everything feels important and you end being paralyzed by the sheer number of tasks you should do. This problem is similar to information overload but with information overload its more about "reading" information than "acting" on that information.
examples of equally important actions/things you can do/work on:
- Mental Health
- Physical Health
- Career
- Interpersonal Relationships
- Philosophy
- Critically thinking abou the future
- Learning History, etc, etc

**Where did this problem come from?**
Back in the day most people were farmers and all they could do during a day was eat, sleep, work the fields, and socialize. Once night hit they didn't have electricity so they just slept or if people were upto it they would socialize at latest midnight. Contrasting that with today, we have an abundance of things we can do just for entertainment: we could watch a movie, scroll through reddit, read a book, watch videos on youtube, use the computer, etc, etc. And these are all just for entertainment, imagine what else you can do.

This is both the drawback and benefit? of the modern era. Several decades ago if I had a kid with BPD there were no resources available for parenting but now there are a plethora of things available at my fingertips. I have more freedom, awareness, and resources to do things I couldn't even imagine before. But all of this isn't without its cons. Freedom always comes with a cost. The options for how I can influence my life for the better are endless but that also means I am stuck choosing and doubting myself if I picked the right thing, "oh and I have to do that next...". My focus becomes divided making me unable to achieve anything.


**Recognize that society is making you feels this way**:


- **You can only do one thing at a time**
- **The hard part is building the habit**
- **Work on at most 3 things**
- **The Rubicon model for deciding**
