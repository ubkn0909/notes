# Schizo & Autism as categories of personalities

by schizo & autist I don't mean their clinical meanings but rather the
stereotypical characterization that is common with them


Autists tend to have high affinity for logic to the point that they sometimes
will draw absurd conclusions just because they are logically but they are
nonsensical once someone observes the context in which they are being spoken.

On the contrary a schizo will pick up associations on even the tiniest of cues
and draw absurd conclusions that are logically incorrect

Schizos & Autists are in this category at the opposite ends of the spectrum



## Applications
- help with writing fictional character personalities (like mbti)
- help determine the precise flaws in thinking (like logical fallacies)
    - "Oh wait I am just being too much of a schizo... need more logic" &
      vice-versa
