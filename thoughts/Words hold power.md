There's a common saying that words hold power but what is this power that
everyone keeps speaking of. Well with words you can:
- make claims and take a stance on issues
- hypothesize, conjecture, suppose, propose
- amuse or entertain
- persuade others/yourself of something, get others/yourself to do something
- pray, promise, promot
- lie, deceive, insult, humiliate
- excuse, comfort, blow off steam
