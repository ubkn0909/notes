## Meta-design
- How do I collect and manage videos or other content for future viewing?
- What is the difference between *questions* and *issues*?

**Areas**
- Consiousness
- Imagination & Creativity

- Should I use asciidoc?
    - its just way better than markdown
    - tags are ineffective organisation structure so what else can I use, and is
      there something natively available in asciidoc

- How can you capture the evolution of thought in digital systems?
    - more specifically how do I show the evolution of thought
    - there is all this praise about git, but how can I use it for writing ig I
      should first understand how it is used in code (there's the philosophy of
      atomic git maybe I can recontextualize it for writing)

- Explore how 'questions' work: I am sure there is atleast one philosopher whose
  thought about how and what questions are
- Explore optimization problems
- Should I start a personal blog? (and host it on those indie sites)
    - honestly I kind of want to, but I am still contemplating
- Monologue vs Dialogue - which are their strenghts and flaws?
- What is freedom truly?
- What is the act of writing and its relation to the act of thinking?
- Explore and list *Paradoxes*
- The act of writing
    - History
    - Theories or frameworks on writing

- What is the point of philosophy? There are so many opinions on any one particular topic, who the
  fuck is right? is there even a right person?
    - the funny thing is this entire question itself is philosophical, its basically asking for
      "What is true?" "How do we know/Can we even know?"
- Can we categorize all questions as either epistemic or instrumental?
- How can we quantify knowledge?
- Is thinking inherently intertwined with emotion? In practice how distinct are feelings and
  thoughts?
    - with this I am mostly thinking about Nietzsche's criticism of Socrates and yk his whole theory
      on how thinking wasn't evolved for "truth" but rather for power. ie thinking has no basis
    - although I am also curious as to what the broad perspectives are on this today (maybe they
      have specific activations of brain regions tied with  either thinking or emotion) 
- What is neuroeconomics about?


## Anthropology
- When and How did empathy evolve?

## History
- Humans weren't afraid of death since the hunter-gatherer days so then why'd they start being
  afraid of death?
- Who were the most influential people in history?
- How did developing countries (ancienct culture/civilisation) acquire knowledge that modern science
  (developed countries) couldn't?

## Psychiatry
- What is the significance of dialectical behavioural Therapy?
- What are the correlations between DBT and Mencius's philosophy? (I saw some parallels from On
  decisions, the-path ) 

## Existential and Axiological



## Expertise
- How should we store tacit knowledge extracted using ACTA? also whats the usefullness of storing
  them?

## Tools for thought
- LOOK into to this shit: https://arxiv.org/html/2507.19726v1
- How can I organise claims and arguments so they are easy to retrieve and reference
    - I am thinking of something like evergreen notes but the main issue I am facing when trying to
      straight up adopt is that I just don't know how long to make an evergreen note and also how to
      not forget about them ig? but like because I think I may end up with like thousands of
      evergreen notes and it'll be pretty hard to rediscover stuff you know what I am saying? You
      know what I need? its some sort of framework for categorizing shit or yk maybe I could
      incorporate this shit with that postmodern-delusions-dissociative-personality-disorder-ass,
      like I'll have personalities with all their claims and arguments listed (sort of similar to
      research sites like researchgate)
    - I think I am also tackling the problem of how to quantify knowledge and sort of systematise it
      digitally but is such a thing even possible?

- what would be the ideal system for thinking?
- what tool for thought can I build for managing ideas?
- is having a "questions" note really the right approach? What about an "ideas" note? Does it even
  matter? Or maybe a third system?
- I need like a database manager for references to resources like yt video, essays, blogs, etc
- is capturing all your thoughts a good idea?
    - there is an obsession of journaling every single thought you have in the
      pkm community, but should you? an avg human has INSERT_DATA number of
      thoughts per INSERT_DATA, they just pop into your head and leave and for
      good reason. Most of the thoughts you have are bad but but what really
      makes a thought good or bad? and isn't it the case that most great ideas
      sound dumb when they are first thought of?
