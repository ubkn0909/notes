Should I start a blog? well I kind of want to even if its not publicly
available. I've been fantasizing about creating something like a hub for my
creative endeavours that would in design incorporate hegalian dialectics and
other theories simply because I wanted to create something radical and unique.

So a static site like the gwern.net would be nice... but I kind of want to build
it with atleast some radical design philosophy in mind and that will take quite
the time to come up with since I'll probably have to do a lot of reading and
shit. Sure I could just restructure the site as I develop those ideas but I just
feel like I want to begin it with a unique feature, the one I currently  have
in mind being able to see the evolution of thoughts. Like I'll have long
works-in-progress drafts/notes/essays with git versioning or something that will
capture & show how the document evolved overtime. I would also like to
incorporate progression through hegelian dialectics but I don't yet fully
understands the process behind hegelian dialectics. And I also want to use
Henrik Karlssons "How to think in writing" as a reference when designing this
site too. All in all it just seems to much of a work.
- I'd like to draw parallels to the practice of atomic git commits in code and
  how it can be applied to writing and thinking

As for the markup language, I'll definitely use asciidoc. It's just far superior
to markdown, the reason for not picking typst is because its html module is
still in its early phases and it doesn't have good interal cross linking
capabilites meanwhile asciidoc has both md and typst beat in those areas.

I also liked Ginger Bill's suggestion of using inline footnotes so I'll
incorporate that as well.

I may most likely use Hugo as my generator because it has native support for
asciidoc and because its written in golang which I am currently interested in
leanring.

I think I'd like to create a "what is happening" page to list all my collection
of claims about the state of the world. For example:
- There is no new aesthetics
    - https://borretti.me/article/there-is-no-new-aesthetics
    - a cultural claim describing the recent lack of new aesthetics

And there also an opportunity to create a timeline view showing when and where
the changes occured.


- Wouldn't it be funny to have a page exploring plans for world domination?


@2026-02-06

Here's what I've decided. Instead of building a shallow indie website written in
bloated html, css, and javascript, I'll instead write the whole damn thing as a
native desktop app (probably using clay for ui). Why? cuz I want to do extreme
experiments with it so I need the flexibility and since I wanna move away from
the browser side of things (websites were a mistake).

For now I wish to halt developments towards a ui/ux/visualizations, but in the
meantime I'll move all of my notes to asciidoc. I'd prefer if the gui was based
on some solid theory and plan for what experiments I'll perform. Right now I
don't even know how to structure this thing but I suppose its fine since Henrik
has a messy vault too and he pumps out some of the most finest pieces of
non-fiction. I'll probably add like a `reading-list`, a `someday-list,` and an
`issues-list`. And for how to proceed with this I'll start learning
critical-thinking, epistemology, and all that other good stuff (guess I'll have
to grab them sources and add them to my reading list).

* what grammar rules should I impose on myself if any? (maybe see what gwern
  does)
