* What should be the purpose of a task management system?
* Why do most task management systems fail?

I think the purpose of a task management system is to really just plan and once
the job is finished forget about it. But what about tracking progress? well you
can look at the 'work' that you did then. Maybe your tasks were about working
on a codebase if so then take a look at its git commit history. What I am saying
is that we should untangle the act of planning and the act of journaling (so we
can track our progress or reflect) seperately. Those are my ideas on the matter
for now
