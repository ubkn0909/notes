# Does free will exist?


Benjamin Libets experiment's of free will caught my attention because of its
interesting conclusion... that free will doesn't exist. I was starting to think
of all the implications of this but it seems the experiment had flaws. I knew it
would have had to have had flaws but well for starters I didn't even know what
the experiment was called and when Dr. K introduced it he kinda dodged the
question of whether free will exists or not.

Well anyways I'd like to hear Zizek's thoughts on free will and well you have
Makishima vouching for the "beauty" of the human soul too. Man I really wish
Makishima had like his own spin off series where he'd go deeper into his
thoughts on things. Like that scene about why he prefers physical books over
digital books, that was just epic.
