# Note taking / Information systems

So I got to reading some evergreen notes of Andy Matuschak again and well yeah
the guy just has so much insight to absorb its just a treasure of knowledge.

Anyways Andy says that "Tags are an ineffective structure" and recommends
against using them. Tags are vague and broad. Things are associated with a tag
without any regards to how relevant it is since there is no way to describe an
explicit relationship with tags, this causes a myriad of things listed in a
jumbled order with no meaning to what is more important to that category or tag.
Hence tags make for an ineffective association structure.

Well shit. And right when I was making actual progress with colman. So what now?
How do I face this dilema? Do I just drop the project? I don't feeling like
dropping the project though.

How about using tags as the first means of organizing references? You would put
interesting new things under the tag-based system and then when you got around
to thoroughly examining the reference material only then would you move it into
the more strict system containing named links. Since making named-links is hard
you'll need to be highly selective of the things you let into your system (which
is a good thing!), but this raises the problem of where to keep the rapid
discovery of fresh references since you can't afford to spend time with each of
them as quickly as they appear thus making them lost. And this is where the
tag-system comes in, it'll just store those references in the meantime you get
around to examining. Now with this process in place, whenever you require
references you'll first look in the primary strict system if you can't find
anything or are looking for more inspirations then you look in the tag-system.
This puts both systems to good use. One keeps the bestest most relevant
references and the other keeps good references.
