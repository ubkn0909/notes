# How to predict the future
Everyone in the entire world is trying to predict the future irrespective of
goals. Whether it be a financial firm (or a degen yoloer) trying to outdo the
market or a country trying to predict which alliances will be favourable and
which not or a company trying to maximize shareholder value, etc. etc. 

Everyone has a desire to predict the future but in order to know the future one
must first understand what is going on "now". This may seem like common sense, I
mean duh if you don't know the current circumstances what are you going to base
your predictions off of. But I think it's not emphasized enough just how crucial
of a task it is to properly evaluate what is happening in the constant flux of
"now".

I think guaging the present is all we can do to predict the future and any
slight deviations that may occur are entirely random and thus out of control.
But I think the "proper" evaluation of the present is probably enough to get
what you want.

All of predicting the future is just properly guaging the dynamic flux of
present conditions.

-> So the question now becomes **"How do you accurately evaluate present
circumstances"**

I honeslty don't know. Cedric did say something about this though. He said to
first train oneself using static materials like already taken events and then
making predictions and judging how well you predicted it to learn. I guess after
training yourself with static material you maybe able to tackle the dynamic
material more easily? buts thats no clear-cut solution. There has to atleast be
some systematic way to go about it (even if it isn't 99% accurate).

- the past is used to predict future even though the future is independant of the
past
