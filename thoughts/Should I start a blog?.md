Should I start a blog? well I kind of want to even if its not publicly
available. I've been fantasizing about creating something like a hub for my
creative endeavours that would in design incorporate hegalian dialectics and
other theories simply because I wanted to create something radical and unique.

So a static site like the gwern.net would be nice... but I kind of want to build
it with atleast some radical design philosophy in mind and that will take quite
the time to come up with since I'll probably have to do a lot of reading and
shit. Sure I could just restructure the site as I develop those ideas but I just
feel like I want to begin it with a unique feature, the one I currently  have
in mind being able to see the evolution of thoughts. Like I'll have long
works-in-progress drafts/notes/essays with git versioning or something that will
capture & show how the document evolved overtime. I would also like to
incorporate progression through hegelian dialectics but I don't yet fully
understands the process behind hegelian dialectics. And I also want to use
Henrik Karlssons "How to think in writing" as a reference when designing this
site too. All in all it just seems to much of a work.
- I'd like to draw parallels to the practice of atomic git commits in code and
  how it can be applied to writing and thinking

As for the markup language, I'll definitely use asciidoc. It's just far superior
to markdown, the reason for not picking typst is because its html module is
still in its early phases and it doesn't have good interal cross linking
capabilites meanwhile asciidoc has both md and typst beat in those areas.

I also liked Ginger Bill's suggestion of using inline footnotes so I'll
incorporate that as well.

I may most likely use Hugo as my generator because it has native support for
asciidoc and because its written in golang which I am currently interested in
leanring.

I think I'd like to create a "what is happening" page to list all my collection
of claims about the state of the world. For example:
- There is no new aesthetics
    - https://borretti.me/article/there-is-no-new-aesthetics
    - a cultural claim describing the recent lack of new aesthetics

And there also an opportunity to create a timeline view showing when and where
the changes occured.


- Wouldn't it be funny to have a page exploring plans for world domination?
