In other words in order to answer the question of "What should one do?", you
must first understand what is being done to *one* (or whats going on in the
world). This sounds super duper obvious but I really struggled with this one ok?
Anyways by understanding what is has happened or is happening to us, you realise
what you must do.

The way things are being done have an underlying philosophy or a set of claims
to them, and to move forward one should call these claims in to question and
make an issue out of them (the critical-thinking kind of issue).

The above is the task of the philosopher as described by Zizek. A philosopher is
someone who calls into question the underlying assumptions in the ideas or
thoughts of why and how something is being done or should be done.
    - damn am I making some connections here, hehehe...
