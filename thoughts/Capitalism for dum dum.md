# What is capitalism
Capitalism is a system that allows individuals to OWN means of production say factory or currently popular: GPUs for training some shit AI to say "I love you" to some lonely degenerate across the globe desperate for any form of human interaction but is too afraid from the real world to act on his desires. Now with this ownership of means of production, you could start a buisiness that has no limitations on what it produces (for example people can sell their bathwater).

## Ok but whats the problem?
So what if people sell their bathwaters or unreasonably expensive bags/fashion clothing. I mean if there wasn't a demand for it the buisiness wouldn't work and fail. The OWNERS are simply meeting the demands of the consumer, at the end of the day the consumer receives what they want and the OWNER gets to make profits. Whats the harm in that?

- critique the demand comes before buisiness argument
The problem is that since there is no obligation to the larger society over what can be produced they end up producing whatever makes them profit. It doesn't matter if employees disagree with a company decision being made (that'll affect them)  because the boss owns the place and his money hungry ass will blindly do anything he thinks will make him money. All of this maximizing profits leads to overproduction of stuff we don't need (but are made to crave for through advertisements) over stuff we do need and this wouldn't be a problem if resources weren't limited on earth but it is and so we end up with poor people being able to afford phones but not being able to put food on the table. 

## In order to make profits the workers are exploited
Say an aspiring "antrapaneur" 

But why is the boss trying to maximize profits?


## The working class is alienated
## The only thing stable is economic unstability
