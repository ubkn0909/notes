# What is capitalism
Capitalism is a system that allows individuals to OWN means of production say factory or currently popular: GPUs for training some shit AI to say "I love you" to some lonely degenerate across the globe desperate for any form of human interaction but is too afraid from the real world to act on his desires. Now with this ownership of means of production, you could start a buisiness that has no limitations on what it produces (for example people can sell their bathwater).

## Ok but whats the problem?
The problem is that since there is no obligation to the larger society over what can be produced they end up producing whatever makes them profit. It doesn't matter if employees disagree with a company decision being made (that'll affect them)  because the boss owns the place and his money hungry ass will blindly do anything he thinks will make him money. All of this maximizing profits leads to overproduction of stuff we don't need (but are made to crave for) over stuff we do need and this wouldn't be a problem if resources weren't limited on earth but it is and so we end with poor people being able to afford phones over food. 

## In order to make pofits the workers are exploited
Say an aspiring "antrapaneur" 

But why is the boss trying to maximize profits?
