Postmordernism is proponent of the ideas of a fragmented self - that there exists no true self rather fragments (some even conflicted or ambivalent) that together form the complex process that is the "self". The self is ever changing never staying the same.
- Now what if I were to cultivate fragments of myself? By that I mean let myself loose and form different alter egos with dialects opposing each other, resolving versions of fragments only to later dissociate into other fragments as a result of evolving through the dialectic method


## Does free will exist
An apprentice asks the question to the Zen master, the Zen master follows with an exercise he asks to student to sit still and... stop thinking. After arduous trial and error the student gives up and proclaims "It's impossible to stop thinking!".  "Exactly" says the master, satisfaction all over his face at succeding in teaching a lesson.

The 'lesson' here was that you are not in control of your thoughts... and if you are not in control of your thoughts then aren't you also helpless as to whatever decisions you make through those thoughts thus meaning that you have no free will.

- But despite that aren't you able to control you arms and feet at command without any thinking? 
- Does that mean I am able to make decisions without any thought or thinking? 
- Well yeah, isn't making decisions based on emotions illustrative of that? shouldn't it be obvious? 
- However when I move my arms around I don't particulary have any emotion behind it, no this is something beyond reason and emotion

Here's a neat little theory I propose. Its true that we have no free will, however only regards to changing the present moment (of thoughts, emotions, etc basically internal stuff) but you can influence what the internal state will be in the future, thus you have the free will to induce thoughts, ideas, or emotions for the future "you" and so you already decide ahead of time. You have free will in creating the conditions of your own non-free will.

**After watching Evers Brothers Production's vid on Does free will exist?**
Ok now I am even more confused, it proposes that free does indeed not exist with empirical evidence to back it up! In fact this is the same empirical evidence Dr. K used in his video of "Does free will exist?" which confused me to no end. He used Nietzsche, Schoppenhauer, and some neurologist to discuss the topic. Nietzsche being the great critic of the church blamed it for the concept of "free will", that if they made people believe in free will they could then exercise judgement & punishment over individuals that our of their "free will" chose to do evil. It has been the case that since time immemorial the concept of free will did not exist. The Greeks thought man to be a play thing of the gods. The gods were named after emotions/desires/values such as the god of love, the god of war, etc. That once possesed by the gods man simply had no say in the matter. And even the christians did not believe in free will apparently. 

But what do I make of all of this? The conclusion of the video was that even if free will is an illusion and that our brain makes decisions in the absence or apriori to conciousness, we can still combat it with knowledge. But how?? it don't make sense to me at all?? isn't knowledge also sort of subjective so who even decides what is truth?? what role does our consciousness even have? are to simply float about the decisions that the brain has already made??

I wonder what Dr. K has to say about this.
