Holyy fuuuck I think Soren Kierkegaard might be my new favourite philosopher. All this time I've been brewing up the idea of perspectives (thinking while pretending to be someone else) and guess what he beat me to it. He uses a bunch of pseudonyms from what I hear and has read/ is into Hegalian philosophy for another mark on the dot. He's literally me!... ok maybe thats an exageration since I don't even know much about him.

I think I should drop the whole "perpecitves" thing and start using pseudonyms... but well, isn't pseydonym somewhat limited. Pseudonyms are false identities are they not?

**Kierkegaard's three individuals:**
1. The hedonist
2. The tragic hero
3. The knight of faith
