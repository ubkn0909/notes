I failed myself again. I said I was gonna do well on this test but it seems like this will go trash as well. Am I really going to succeed in NEET? Will I really be able to do it? I don't know. I really don't know. I just want college I don't care what it is, well I kind of do but please I just... don't want to waste this year aswell. Even IISER will do

Alright so here's what I need to do for backups:
- for iiser
	- start studying high scoring chaps maths late december
	- start solving pyqs
- for cuet (also late december)
	- start researching colleges and courses
	- start studying general knowledge and english

Btech courses that take up NEET. Tharpur

CUET -> Bsc bitoech -> iit jam (200 rank)
