Here's how to overcome the fantasy trap:
1. Sit with the negativity
2. Think about the next step to take

Living in the present sucks which is why we try to escape it through fantasies or by numbing overselves with doom scrolling. But the truth is, the only time we are alive is in the present moment because it's the only time we can act. The present moment is the only time we have the freedom to do something.
