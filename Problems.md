The current circumstances are:
- I have no financial freedom
- I have <7 months to positively change my circumstances
- I have a personal home and food though my diet lacks meat

**Task Management**
A quick note of how I plan to manage my tasks. I'll use three things:
- Physical notebook
- Chapter Status Cards
- Obsidian Journal
- Samsung Calendar
*Physical Notebook*: the physical notebook will be used for quickly jotting down things like ideas and if worth it will be explored in the journal. They will be used to note down any doubts that come up in studies. And finally they will be used for tracking chore tasks.

*Chapter Status Cards*: These will be just a paper/s that will record progress in learning a particular chapter of a particular subject. They will be placed on their respective chapter in the Allen Module. These will include things like: i) list of useful procedures, ii) tasks w/t completion date, iii) pending/future tasks

*Obsidian Journal*: The journal will be used to capture daily reflection, therefore task completion, in order to be synthesised into a larger reflection/test file that draws upon a conclusion. It will be used to capture emotions and intuitions as well. And just a place to have fun with writing.

*Samsung Calendar*: This will be used mostly for planning weekends but also for a birds eye view of upcoming week/month. I'll throw whatever comes to mind that I don't have the time to seriously think about on some time block in future.
