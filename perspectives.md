# Multi-perspective approach
- Whenever you are learning you have a goal in mind
- Learning cannot take place if you don't have a goal
- What determines your goals? Your identity or your role

We'll call the combination of your identity, role, and goals a 'perspective'.
Now there are obviously going to be a large number of perspectives in the world
so the obvious question becomes:
- What are the broad types of perspectives?

I think we can classify perspectives as global and local. Global perspectives
are applicable in any domain but local perspectives are domain specific.
- Global perspectives may be:
    * Historical
    * Economical
    * Regulatory (identity based)
- Local perspectives may be:
    * Physicist: 1) Theoretical 2) Experimental
    * Chemist
    * Zoologist

A thing about all perspectives is that they have a philosophy. Which is obvious
since they have goals.


## Whats the point?
But you may be wondering what the point of thinking about several perspectives
is. Well to create an accurate mental model of any domain/subject you need to
analyse it from different angles or perspectives. So by actively collecting
perspectives one can easily switch to the relevant perspectives and build
richer models of a domain. This also brings awareness to what the objective
of the learning activity is, otherwise you may feel lost and running around in
circles without really making any progress in a domain.

This is also the strategy in complex adaptive systems, though it'll probably be
extremely difficult to use the multi-perspectives approach individually because
well... its complex, it will be very hard. The way to getting the most accurate
prediction therefore having an accurate model is to let a bunch of people
(with different perspectives) argue on what the correct way of
viewing/interpreting the situation is and with each discourse refining the
model until you have a fairly accurate model that can fairly predict future
outcomes.
