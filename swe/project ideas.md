- review:
	- a program that periodically helps you review your files such as pictures, videos and perhaps notes by randomly showing them to you
	- sort of like anki but for your entire file system
	- helps in staying organised and clean with files
	- also helps in remembering stuff that often gets forgotten (like pictures from 10 years ago)

# irl stuff
- force feedback vr controller gloves
- ~7 inch knightmare robot (controllable w/t vr gloves)
- diy neurofeedback (for "biohacking" or whatever you want to use it for)
# Graphics programming
- 3d simulation game with code geass like mecha (controllable via vr gloves)
- procedural 2d animation (eg: lizard motion)
- cube world inspired (non-voxel?) RPG 3D adventure game
	- so I just read the recent dev(b)logs of cube world omega and he procedurally generates character models! this also includes different species like evles, lizardmen, etc
	- he must do animations procedurally and looking back they are actually very simple. I want to try this.
- picoCAD & doom-inspired (specifically custom level editor of jdh) 3d modelling software for game dev and just creating art
