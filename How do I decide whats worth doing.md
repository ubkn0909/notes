Dr. K said something abou this that I want to think explore.
He said that it doesn't really matter if you've made the "right" choice or "wrong" choice. 
What? this doesn't make an ounce of sense to me. So what did he mean by it?

In the long run it doesn't really matter whether you've made the right choice or the wrong choice what really matters is your commitment to that choice. Because:
- You can never really know if a choice is right or wrong beforehand. The fact that you are struggling to decide is proof of that. There is some uncertainty preventing you from making a clear-cut decision.
- Someone who commits to a choice sees-through it quickly and thus recaliberate that quickly as well (if the choice turns out to be the wrong one)
- Does Dr. K raise some suspicion on what a "right" and "wrong" choice even is?

So... what just pick anything based on gut feeling and go with it? No thats not a satisfactory answer. Need to do more research.
