hand controls are op, If we take a look A lot of controller designs today (for robots, rc car, etc)
have very limited input (as compared to how much our hands are capable of). Take a simple xbox
controller for example. Suppose you were controlling a robot dog with it. You would be able to
perform simple movments sure but a robot dog has 23 DOF and a controller only has like X so what
you'd essentially need to do is to make certain mechanics automatic. But imagine the complex
movments that maybe possible with more manual control. Its similar to comparing a manual car and an
automatic car in my opinion. An automatic car is just fine for everyday usage but likely won't be
used for street racing because a manual car simply just allows for so much more precise control that
its a nobrainer.
- That gives me another idea, maybe I should have like an "automatic" mode for controlling
  robots/ingame mecha

On the other hand, if we track all the movements of our hands we have so much more input that can be
us


# Real life examples of hand input devices:
- keyboard: probably the most relevant one
- stylus/pen: comes from actual pens which who knows for how long we've been using for
  data-interaction
- datahand/svalboard
- touch screen?
