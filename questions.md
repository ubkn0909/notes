**Areas**
- Consiousness

- What is freedom truly?
- What is the act of writing and its relation to the act of thinking?

- What is the point of philosophy? There are so many opinions on any one particular topic, who the fuck is right? is there even a right person?
	- the funny thing is this entire question itself is philosophical, its basically asking for "What is true?" "How do we know/Can we even know?"
- Can we categorize all questions as either epistemic or instrumental?
- How can we quantify knowledge?
- Is thinking inherently intertwined with emotion? In practice how distinct are feelings and thoughts?
	- with this I am mostly thinking about Nietzsche's criticism of Socrates and yk his whole theory on how thinking wasn't evolved for "truth" but rather for power. ie thinking has no basis
	- although I am also curious as to what the broad perspectives are on this today (maybe they have specific activations of brain regions tied with  either thinking or emotion) 
- What is neuroeconomics about?
