# Thinking about collection management
ref: "Unbundling tools for thought", bkmr(cli), grit(cli), TagStudio

UTFT suggests that what we really need instead of knowledge-management is
collection-management. A collection manager is basically software that manages collections
of "things" (these things can either be links, text, code-snippets, etc).


What I really liked with each software:
- TagStudio:
	- tagstudio has a really nice design/philosophy to organizing things
	- A problem that I immediately notice is the overload of tags. Anything can be tagged
	  in a number of ways so we'll have the trim the fat and keep the important tags. but
	  then the question becomes: How do you decide what tags are more useful?

- grit:
	- I really liked grit's underlying implementation, it uses multi-tree's to represent
	"nodes" so everything is a node even tags. I really liked that idea and would love to
	see more


- bkmr:
	- bkmr seems to best capture what I want
	- It has good search function
