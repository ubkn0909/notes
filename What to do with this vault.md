I can use this obsidian vault for:
- problem/goal tracking -> long-term - problems, short-term - journal(daily)
- evaluating effective pragmatic solutions for them
- reflecting on tests conducted to adjust evaluation -> tests should have a seperate folder

Before I was trying all the self-help advice on a whim and who knows what actually worked and what I maybe misunderstood. I need to be more rigorous in order to be effective and know what actually works and what doesn't. You know kind of similar to Henrik Karlsson idea of "Rationality is an underrated way of being authentic" (I am saying kind of because I haven't properly digested the piece and I am basing this off of what fragments I remember).


- claim: the world is fundamentally capricious (disordered, complex, or chaotic)
	- this relates to Henrik's *unfolding* process
	- this I think is supported by quantum mechanics
	- even if we were to assume the world to be deterministic it is still far too complex for an individual (to predict the future)
	- thus we must act accordingly to thrive in this incoherent & unstable world
	- antithesis: the world is rational, stable and coherent 
		-  this relates to _visionary_ thinking
		- this says to use purely rational thinking and excessive planning to thrive
		- it claims 


- claim: An integration of emotional and rational aspects of self is a better way of living than purely emotional or purely rational ways of living (the heart-mind Mencius or wise-mind from DBT)
	- there are three approaches to making decisions: emotional thinking, rational thinking, wise-mind/heart-mind
	- use of *Rational* thinking for decisions is done by excessive planning & thinking
		- this assumes that the world is stable enough for plans to be effective for years 
		- and that to thrive one should plan more
	- use of *Emotional/Gut* feeling is done when 




Goals should serve as interfaces (programming) leaving the function body (solution) upto iteration through tests (TDD). I honestly really like this analogy, it just fits so neatly.
