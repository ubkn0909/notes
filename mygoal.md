A pitfall that I fall into when pursuing goals of academic success is searching
for how to study efficiently basically I try to hyper-optimise it and end up
actually doing nothing.
- Dr. K had apparently fallen into the same pitfall but how he managed to get
out of it was to recognize that
    1) he was focusing on the outcome more than the present
    2) the only things he can control are his actions
I think this problem is a classic case of overthinking... right?


# my current goal
Let's first aim to meet out fundamental needs and then focus on our larger goal
(yet to be fully articulated). My fundamental needs are:
- housing, food/water, clothing, time-to-myself, good location(rid of pollution)
- resources for pursuing my hobby (like money for a computer)

Short term goal:
- crack NEET and get into a good govt college
    * I plan on getting student loans but I lack proper info regarding the
    risks and procedures -> study (personal) finance, law, career-market

Long term goal/surplus-enjoyment:
- Mastery of mastery
    * 

## Collecting info
I should study basic:
- finance
- law
- Reading 'How to think in writing' (by Henrik Karlsson) may also prove to be useful.

## Possible paths
1. Get into a good govt. med school in India
2. Get into IISER
3. Go abroad for med school


# There are two types of goals:
- solution-defining: These are goals that lose sight of the actual purpose of
  the goal with the form/appearance of the solution. Sometimes itâ€™ll be bundled
  with the purpose. For example:...

- purpose-defining: These goals only define what the purpose of the goal is. It
  will accept any solution so long as it fullfils the purpose of the goal. It
  focusses on the effect of the solution and not the form of the solution.
  Among the two purpose-defing goals are compatible with the iterative process
  of unfolding.
