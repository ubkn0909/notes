A pitfall that I fall into when pursuing goals of academic success is searching
for how to study efficiently basically I try to hyper-optimise it and end up
actually doing nothing.
- Dr. K had apparently fallen into the same pitfall but how he managed to get
out of it was to recognize that
    1) he was focusing on the outcome more than the present
    2) the only things he can control are his actions
I think this problem is a classic case of overthinking... right?


# my current goal
Let's first aim to meet out fundamental needs and then focus on our larger goal
(yet to be fully articulated). My fundamental needs are:
- housing, food/water, clothing, time-to-myself, good location(rid of pollution)
- resources for pursuing my hobby (like money for a computer)

Short term goal:
- crack NEET and get into a good govt college
    * I plan on getting student loans but I lack proper info regarding the
    risks and procedures -> study (personal) finance, law, career-market

Long term goal/surplus-enjoyment:
- Mastery of mastery
    * 

## Collecting info
I should study basic:
- finance
- law
- Reading 'How to think in writing' (by Henrik Karlsson) may also prove to be useful.

## Possible paths
1. Get into a good govt. med school in India
2. Get into IISER
3. Go abroad for med school


# There are two types of goals:
- solution-defining: These are goals that lose sight of the actual purpose of
  the goal with the form/appearance of the solution. Sometimes itâ€™ll be bundled
  with the purpose. For example:...

- purpose-defining: These goals only define what the purpose of the goal is. It
  will accept any solution so long as it fullfils the purpose of the goal. It
  focusses on the effect of the solution and not the form of the solution.
  Among the two purpose-defing goals are compatible with the iterative process
  of unfolding.


# The paradox of desire
Lacanian desire says that the true pleasure(Jouissance) received from desire
isn't from the gain of the desire but rather the pursuit itself. Because after
having achieved your desire you realise in horror that you are now empty again.
You still feel incomplete as if lacking something and so you fixate on another
desire until you reach it and repeat the cycle all over again.

Using Marxist terms, true enjoyment doesn't come from the value in desire
(value gained by having it) but rather it is a surplus value, the value gained
not from possessing the object of desire but rather something else. Thus its
called surplus enjoyment. Its enjoyment recieved not from acquiring desire but
from the pursuit of desire

An example to illustrate this perfectly is that of a newborn child. A newborn
learns to suck as a survival mechanism so we say that it has a desire to suck I
mean it will die otherwise so it makes sense for the brain to desire 'sucking'
but something contradictory happens when you fetch it a pacifier. You'd expect
the child to stop sucking the pacifier since no milk comes out of a pacifier
and so it doesn't make sense for it to continue but the baby does. It continue
on and on. So it must be receiving pleasure to reinforce such behaviour but
what from? it can't be the desire for milk but he doesn't receive it. The
pleasure then comes from the process of acquiring the object of desire which in
this case is the milk. Hence the baby receives surplus enjoyment from the
behaviour of sucking.

Surplus enjoyment I think can also be empirically proven by the
neurotransmitter dopamine. Neuroscience has found out that the pleasure
recieved from dopamine isn't when the reward is acquired but rather it is
release in the anticipation of a reward (we're talking in terminologies of
reward because I think they conducted experiemnts on mouses to find this out)


So then I think the paradox can speak for itself but I'll do the speaking
anyways. We don't actually want to fulfill our desires but then what should we
desire? Should we even pursue our desires if they are actually not what we want?

The Buddisht would tell us to not pursue our desires but Zizek disagrees. He
thinks that it is flawed to think that we shouldn't pursue our desire, that we
musn't betray our desire.
- So then what should we strive for? (look into drive or the desire from a lack)
