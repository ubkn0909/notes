- I ought to buy those Biotech engineered plant purifiers for apartments (that are apparently 20x more efficient than regular house plants)

## Housing
Suffice to say this is going to be a very long term goal of mine, and I am wondering if it is even feasible but I guess I'll just do my best for now and leave the rest to the future me.

I think I would like to live in rural area surrounded by farms or forests with a custom house thats off-grid. Of course it'll need to support all of my antics like electricity, high speed internet connection and all other stuff I'd like to do. I am thinking of growing everything I eat on my own, though that will be difficult when it comes to seafoods.

**Infrastructure**
- look into Passive house designs
- Old victorian-esque house are something else
- There was an open source modular house project (along with other stuff like tractors, etc) worth checking out
- Every house design is built with certain values in mind so what should be mine?

**Location**
- The country should have laws that don't prevent me from growing shit and making shit

**Food**
- For vegetables
	- I want to try something like vertical farming or maybe its alternatives
	- I'd like to grow: mushrooms,
- For Meat:
	- Rabbit is apparently the best choice for low maintenance meat according to some-bloke-on-yt ([[rabbit-farm]])
		- Fish meat will the most difficult to get around
