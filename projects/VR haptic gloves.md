I fucking really want to build me my own VR haptic gloves. I want to primarily use it as an input device like a keyboard and a mouse

## hand controls are op
Why are most input interfaces engineered for hands?
If we take a look 

A lot of controller designs today (for robots, rc car, etc) have very limited input (as compared to how much our hands are capable of). Take a simple xbox controller for example. Suppose you were controlling a robot dog with it. You would be able to perform simple movments sure but a robot dog has 23 DOF and a controller only has like X so what you'd essentially need to do is to make certain mechanics automatic. But imagine the complex movments that maybe possible with more manual control. Its similar to comparing a manual car and an automatic car in my opinion. An automatic car is just fine for everyday usage but likely won't be used for street racing because a manual car simply just allows for so much more precise control that its a nobrainer.
- That gives me another idea, maybe I should have like an "automatic" mode for controlling robots/ingame mecha

On the other hand, if we track all the movements of our hands we have so much more input that can be used. 


## resources required
- 3d printer
- hot glue?
- soldering kit
- esp32 (or something similar)
- hall effect sensors
- strap?? (so it doesn't fall off me hands)
- motors for force feedback

## ideas for what it should do 
- I want to use these vr gloves to control a mehca/knightmare(code geass) in game
- I want to use it for typing in any position I want (also want speed so I may steal Characorder's design)
- I'd like to try and use it for mouse input if thats possible
- Actually fuck it I want to replace every possible input method with this thing

- It needs to be extremely lightweight so I don't feel any strain after extensive hours of usage
