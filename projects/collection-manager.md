collection manager or colman (na(e)col(r) - nature collection)  is my idea for the ideal collection management software. I'll combine what I like from:
- bkmr
- TagStudio
- grit

ideas for design:
- attribute value tags
- everything is a node and connected into a multi-tree
- database will be in sql(lite) and will support seperate database integration
- nodes can be files, http-links(bookmark), snippet code, shell script, any custom object (like a book, film, anime, light-novel, etc, etc)
- full blown tui for easy searching/organising

I am not sure if I want to use Odin or Go to write this. Odin is the new hot thing I am trying but it doesn't have a strong library for tui's or any other cli. Go on the other hand has an entire ecosystem of cli frameworks (Charm libraries: bubbletea, lipgloss)
