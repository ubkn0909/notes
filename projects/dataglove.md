# Dataglove 
The name is a play on "datahand" which was a unique keyboard design that later
hobbiest took to the next level revamping it to "svalboard". Both are soo
fucking cool, I'll need to explore those bad boys on their own sometime. And so
I want to create my own unique design for keyboard input and perhaps mouse
inputs as well

So my(actually stole all of it) idea is a haptic vr glove. It'll have force
feedback so whatever you interact with in the virtual reality will give you real
feedback. How will this become a keyboard? simple by having a digital virtual
keyboard that you can interact with. Since its all digital the designs are
unlimmited for what it could be, heck I bet you can even replicate the
standard keyboard but I will go for a svalboard-like design. Keyboard input is
probably a disrespect to the capabilites of this thing. You could do soo much
with it (interact with virtual objects or people, some mixed reality shit (who
knows, the possibilities are endless), etc.). 

## skills required
- CAD, 3d printing
- electronics
- firmware programming

## ideas for what it should do 
- I want to use these gloves to control a mehca/knightmare(code geass) in
  game
- I want to use it for typing in any position I want (also want speed so I may
  steal Characorder's design)
- I'd like to try and use it for mouse input if thats possible
- Actually fuck it I want to replace every possible input method with this thing
- It needs to be extremely lightweight so I don't feel any strain after even
  after extensive hours of usage

## software: firmware & driver programming
It'll need to implement VR in some way so I can leverage already made VR stuff



## hardware
### resources required
- 3d printer -> I'm thinkin of just hand molding some pvc pipes (or if available
  flatsheets)
- hot glue
- soldering kit
- esp32 (or something similar)
- hall effect sensors
- strap?? (so it doesn't fall off me hands)
- motors for force feedback
