- review:
    - a program that periodically helps you review your files such as pictures, videos and perhaps
      notes by randomly showing them to you
    - sort of like anki but for your entire file system
    - helps in staying organised and clean with files
    - also helps in remembering stuff that often gets forgotten (like pictures from 10 years ago)

# irl stuff
- **emotion recognising ml algorithm using wifi!**
    - made possible by latest research showing non-contact heartrate monitoring method based on wifi
      (https://doi.org/10.3390/s24072111)
- force feedback vr controller gloves #hci
- ~7 inch knightmare robot (controllable w/t vr gloves)
- diy neurofeedback using electrodes (for "biohacking" or whatever you want to use it for)
- RC Car 

# Graphics programming
- 3d simulation game with code geass like mecha (controllable via vr gloves) #hci
- horse racing game
    - I want to create a more controllable horse mechanic; 
    - I want to replicate somthing similar to balancing the forces that you have to do in racing
      games (simracing)
    - What if instead of directly controlling the horse you try to keep the rider on the horse and
      let the horse do its thing like entering flow or the dao. So there'll be a rythm to it and
      it'll play like sekiro 
- procedural 2d animation (eg: lizard motion)
- cube world inspired (non-voxel?) RPG 3D adventure game
    - so I just read the recent dev(b)logs of cube world omega and he apparently procedurally
      generates character models! this also includes different species like evles, lizardmen, etc
    - he must do animations procedurally and looking back they are actually very simple. I want to
      try this.
- picoCAD & doom-inspired (specifically custom level editor of jdh) 3d modelling software for game
  dev and just creating art
