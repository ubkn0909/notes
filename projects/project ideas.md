- review:
    - a program that periodically helps you review your files such as pictures, videos and perhaps
      notes by randomly showing them to you
    - sort of like anki but for your entire file system
    - helps in staying organised and clean with files
    - also helps in remembering stuff that often gets forgotten (like pictures from 10 years ago)

# irl stuff
- a fantasy console that promotes creativity (basically an alternate to phones & social media)
    - I am thinking that instead of procedurally generating the overworld or hand designing it why
      not let it be a free for all like r/place. Because humans are capable of creating harmonius
      stuff without speech (they just know cuz empathy bs)
    - I was also thinking about adding digital pets so it'd be similar to tomogatchi and instead of
      isolating individuals by artificially filling the void of their loneliness the pets would
      rather encourage even more human interaction, it'll become the excuse to get to know someone.
      How you ask? well you see, I am sure you know the cliche of pets of the mcs of a romcom start
      playing with each other in a park and thats how the love interests meet and continue to meet
      and yk the usual romance stuff happens
    - overall I just want this to not be an escape and instead a tool for more creativity and
      sharing something valuable with everyone (maybe this won't work but whatever I am still gonna
      make it for personal interests and maybe as a thing to share with my friends)
    - I'll also have like irl pokemon battles type stuff
    - wouldn't it be cool if this worked on a different protocol than wifi (maybe something similar
      to meshtastic)
    - HOLY hell did I get ahead of myself and wrote an essay on my fantasy. Anyways I need to first
      get the concept and idea of this down before I deal with the technical stuff

- **emotion recognising ml algorithm using wifi!**
    - made possible by latest research showing non-contact heartrate monitoring method based on wifi

- [[dataglove]]: force feedback vr controller gloves #hci
- ~7 inch knightmare robot (controllable w/t vr gloves)
- diy neurofeedback using electrodes (for "biohacking" or whatever you want to use it for)
- RC Car 
- mess around with some custom small factor input designs



# Graphics programming
- 3d simulation game with code geass like mecha (controllable via vr gloves) #hci
- horse racing game
    - I want to create a more controllable horse mechanic; 
    - I want to replicate somthing similar to balancing the forces that you have to do in racing
      games (simracing)
    - What if instead of directly controlling the horse you try to keep the rider on the horse and
      let the horse do its thing like entering flow or the dao. So there'll be a rythm to it and
      it'll play like sekiro 
- procedural 2d animation (eg: lizard motion)
- cube world inspired (non-voxel?) RPG 3D adventure game
    - so I just read the recent dev(b)logs of cube world omega and he apparently procedurally
      generates character models! this also includes different species like evles, lizardmen, etc
    - he must do animations procedurally and looking back they are actually very simple. I want to
      try this.
- picoCAD & doom-inspired (specifically custom level editor of jdh) 3d modelling software for game
  dev and just creating art
