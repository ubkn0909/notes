How and when should I learn buisiness expertise?
This is clearly going to help me out lots. Both in personal-financial aspects
and in understanding the world more clearly. Learning market & operations
currently seem most interesting to me but if I wanted to start my own buisiness
I supposed I'd have to learn capital as well but that'll come later first I need
to be employed.

What exactly are my goals with this?
- understanding larger economic developments: what is happening in the world?
- personal career development & investment
- forming personal opinions on what is right 

## Triads
- Operations
- Market
- Capital


## Market
My current objective is to understand the market.

All of market is about demand and supply.

but what will understanding the market allow me to do? Who in the first needs to
understand the market anywho?

Who understands market in the first place?
- marketing, 


skills:
- uncovering customer demand
