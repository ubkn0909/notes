What are evergreen notes? well they are an experiment Andy Matuschak is playing with for his personal research and knowledge work (TODO: I should learn about knowledge work someday). He sees the current note taking practices are shallow and counterproductive.

- Evergreen notes should be atomic
- Knowledge work should accrete

excerpt:
**Prefer positive note titles to promote systematic theory**
When writing Evergreen notes, it’s tempting to write notes like “X is bad” or “Y doesn’t work.” Prefer instead to write note titles which express the property or requirement in a positive sense.

If you’ve thought them through, negatively-oriented notes usually contain a descriptive theory of why the missing/flawed property is important. By bringing that theory to the foreground, you make it easier to see the claims in a systematic context, which, in turn, makes it easier to build on.

For example:

Metacognitive supports require dynamic, participatory environments, not “Passive environments can’t offer good metacognitive support”
Use phones to collect and triage, not (usually) to read, not “Don’t read on your phone”
